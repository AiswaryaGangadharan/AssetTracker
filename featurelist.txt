ASSETTRACKER – FEATURE LIST


 What I understood from the client
The client wants a software system to manage company assets.
The main idea is to know which company item is currently with which employee.
This will help the company avoid confusion and keep track of assets properly instead of using manual methods.


 Creative choices I made
- I named the product as “AssetTracker”.
- The system will be a simple web application.
- The project focuses on tracking assets.
- Assets are grouped into simple categories like laptops, mobiles, and other accessories.


 Assumptions made
- One asset can be given to only one employee at a time.
- Only admin or authorized staff can add or assign assets.
- Employees cannot change asset details.


 Features planned

1. Employee Details  
   The system will store employee information such as name, employee ID, and department.

2. Asset Details  
   The system will store details of company assets like asset name, type, and status.

3. Asset Assignment  
   Assets can be assigned to employees and the assignment date will be stored.

4. Asset Status  
   Each asset will show whether it is available, assigned, or under maintenance.

5. Asset History  
   Previous asset assignments can be viewed for reference.

6. Search Option  
   Users can search for assets or employees easily.

7. Basic Dashboard  
   A simple dashboard to show total assets and assigned assets.


 Questions for the next client meeting
1. Do you want different user roles like admin and employee?
2. Should employees be able to see the assets assigned to them?
3. Do you need notifications when assets are assigned or returned?
4. Is mobile access required?
5. Do you want the option to upload data in bulk?
